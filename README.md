# Off-line-AVRISP
electronic scrap, it was failed and simply not be able to burn AVR chip, but why ?  

[U$60 at selling price](https://world.taobao.com/item/73238096.htm) but no more usable, replaced to be with trusted my own design of [usbtiny](https://github.com/xiaolaba/usbtiny-ATtiny2313-upgrade-ISP-modification).   
this saying off-line AVR programmer was no longer working, does not matter power the target by external supply or this programmer. Return to selling was just simply not feasible as because the shipping cost and repairing bueget.
